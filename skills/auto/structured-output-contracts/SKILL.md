description: Use when producing machine-readable output from logs or other structured records with naming, ordering, or schema constraints.

- Treat the required schema and normalization rules as a contract; do not assume input values or order already conform.
- Normalize specified identifiers consistently while preserving unrelated fields and values.
- Sort records by the full required key, including tie-breakers, in the stated direction.
- Include required top-level metadata and version fields exactly as specified.
- Parse the finished output and verify required keys, value types, normalized values, and ordering before delivery.
